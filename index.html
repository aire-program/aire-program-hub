            <p>“The Applied AI Innovation and Research Enablement (AIRE) Program is a coordinated initiative in the College of Social Science at Michigan State University. It supports responsible and effective use of artificial intelligence across teaching, research, and academic operations by providing a connected set of learning, experimentation, and analytics resources.”</p>
            <p>“AIRE brings together AI literacy development, research experimentation, and institutional insight in one program. It gives faculty, staff, students, and leadership practical ways to explore AI, test workflows, and make informed decisions based on evidence.”</p>
          </div>
          <p class="meta">“Originally developed on internal MSU systems and later mirrored to GitHub with synthetic data, AIRE demonstrates how an academic unit can build an AI enablement ecosystem that is both well-governed and adaptable. The public mirror allows other institutions to examine the program’s structure and workflows without exposing confidential information.”</p>
