          <div class="hero-body">
            <p>The Applied AI Innovation &amp; Research Enablement (AIRE) Program is a college-level initiative in the College of Social Science at Michigan State University. It is designed to support responsible, effective use of artificial intelligence across teaching, research, and academic operations.</p>
            <p>AIRE brings together AI literacy, research experimentation, and institutional analytics into a coordinated program. It helps faculty, staff, students, and leadership develop practical skills, experiment with new workflows, and base decisions about AI adoption on clear evidence rather than hype.</p>
          </div>
          <p class="meta">Originally developed on internal MSU systems and later mirrored to GitHub, AIRE demonstrates how a large academic unit can build an AI enablement ecosystem that combines learning resources, experimentation environments, and data-informed program management.</p>

        <p class="lead">AIRE is structured around three interconnected components that serve different audiences while working toward the same goal: responsible, well-governed use of AI across the college.</p>

            <h3>AIRE Literacy Hub</h3>
            <p>The AIRE Literacy Hub provides learning pathways, tutorials, and teaching materials to help faculty, staff, students, and researchers develop practical, responsible AI skills. It focuses on widely available tools and emphasizes ethics, accessibility, and measurable learning impact so that AI adoption supports teaching and student success rather than distracting from it.</p>

            <h3>AIRE Researcher Sandbox</h3>
            <p>The AIRE Researcher Sandbox is a method-focused environment where researchers and graduate students can experiment with AI-enabled workflows in a controlled, well-documented setting. Reproducible notebooks and Colab-ready modules walk users through OCR, entity recognition, embeddings, retrieval-augmented generation, and evaluation strategies that can be adapted to real research projects in the social sciences and related fields.</p>

            <h3>AIRE Impact Dashboard</h3>
            <p>The AIRE Impact Dashboard is the program’s decision-intelligence layer. Built with Streamlit and Plotly, it consolidates synthetic mirrors of participation, confidence, and readiness data to show how AI literacy efforts are developing across departments and roles. The internal MSU deployment ran on secure college data; this public version preserves the analytic model and key performance indicators using carefully designed synthetic datasets.</p>

        <h2>How AIRE Is Used Across the College</h2>
        <div class="usage-grid">
          <div>
            <p>In practice, AIRE supports different kinds of work for different audiences. Instructors use the Literacy Hub to embed responsible AI activities into courses and advising. Researchers and graduate students work in the Sandbox to prototype AI-enabled workflows on their own data before bringing them into funded projects, collaborations, and publications. Leadership teams consult the Impact Dashboard when planning professional development, organizing faculty support, and allocating resources for future terms.</p>
            <p>Because these components share a common language of governance, documentation, and analytics, it becomes easier to see how learning activities, research practices, and institutional decisions relate. The same indicators that appear in the dashboard can flow back into the design of new workshops, resources, and sandbox modules, creating a continuous cycle of learning, experimentation, and improvement.</p>
          </div>
          <aside class="callout">
            <h3>Learning, Experimentation, and Insight</h3>
            <p>AIRE is deliberately designed as a cycle. Individuals and departments build skills through the Literacy Hub. Research teams experiment with methods and workflows in the Sandbox. Leadership uses the Impact Dashboard to understand where responsible AI practice is taking root, where adoption is uneven, and where additional support or mentoring is needed. The result is a program that can evolve over time based on actual usage patterns and measurable learning impact.</p>

            <p>Leadership, department chairs, and program directors use the AIRE Impact Dashboard to understand participation patterns, confidence gains, departmental readiness, and emerging needs. The dashboard provides a concise view of where AI literacy efforts are taking hold, where adoption is uneven, and which units may require prioritized support or targeted professional development.</p>

            <h3>Researchers &amp; Graduate Students</h3>
            <p>Researchers and graduate students use the AIRE Researcher Sandbox to trial AI-enabled workflows in a reproducible environment. Notebooks illustrate complete pipelines—from data preparation to evaluation—that can be adapted to lab-specific datasets and research questions. The emphasis is on practical methods, transparent assumptions, and workflows that can be documented in grant proposals, protocols, and publications.</p>

            <h3>Faculty, Staff &amp; Students</h3>
            <p>Faculty, staff, and students use the AIRE Literacy Hub to explore tutorials, micro-courses, and teaching-ready materials that introduce AI in ways that are practical, ethical, and grounded in disciplinary practice. The hub supports introductory exploration, course integration, and ongoing professional learning without assuming a technical background.</p>

        <h2>Governance, Data, and Responsible AI</h2>
        <p class="lead">AIRE treats governance and data stewardship as core design elements rather than afterthoughts. Internal deployments use college data under existing institutional policies, while public mirrors use synthetic datasets so that methods and structures can be shared openly without exposing confidential information.</p>
        <p>Across the Literacy Hub, Researcher Sandbox, and Impact Dashboard, the program emphasizes:</p>
        <ul class="governance-list">
          <li>clear documentation of how AI tools are used in teaching, research, and operations</li>
          <li>attention to privacy, consent, and data minimization in internal workflows</li>
          <li>transparent use of synthetic data in public examples and demonstrations</li>
          <li>reproducible methods that can be reviewed, adapted, and audited</li>
          <li>alignment with institutional values around equity, accessibility, and inclusion</li>
