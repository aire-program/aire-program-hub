            <p>“The Applied AI Innovation and Research Enablement (AIRE) Program is a coordinated initiative in the College of Social Science at Michigan State University. It supports responsible and effective use of artificial intelligence across teaching, research, and academic operations by providing a connected set of learning, experimentation, and analytics resources.”</p>
            <p>“AIRE brings together AI literacy development, research experimentation, and institutional insight in one program. It gives faculty, staff, students, and leadership practical ways to explore AI, test workflows, and make informed decisions based on evidence.”</p>
          </div>
          <p class="meta">“Originally developed on internal MSU systems and later mirrored to GitHub with synthetic data, AIRE demonstrates how an academic unit can build an AI enablement ecosystem that is both well-governed and adaptable. The public mirror allows other institutions to examine the program’s structure and workflows without exposing confidential information.”</p>

          <div>
            <p>“In practice, AIRE supports different kinds of work across the college. Instructors use the Literacy Hub to introduce responsible AI activities into courses and advising. Researchers and graduate students rely on the Sandbox to test workflows before applying them to funded projects. Leadership teams consult the Impact Dashboard to understand participation patterns and areas where focused support may be helpful.”</p>
            <p>“The shared framework across components makes it easier to connect learning activities, research workflows, and institutional decision making. Indicators from the dashboard help inform the design of new workshops and Sandbox modules. Feedback collected through the Micro Tutor and Scorecard contributes to the development of future learning materials. This creates a cycle of learning, experimentation, and improvement that can adjust as needs change.”</p>
